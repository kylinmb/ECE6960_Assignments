    "\n",
    "You are expected to complete this notebook with lines of code, plots and texts. You will need to create new cells with original code or text for your analyses. This assignment has a total of 100 points and 5 questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Canvas, you will deliver the notebook file (.ipynb) with cells executed and outputs visible.\n",
    "- You should use PyTorch 1.0 or later as your deep learning framework. If you need to import a different package than the ones already imported, ask the TA if you can do it.\n",
    "- No other data than the dataset variables provided should be used, and training, validation and testing splits should be the same as the ones provided.\n",
    "- The cell outputs present in your delivered notebook should be reproducible by us by running your notebook cells in order.\n",
    "- All code must be your own work. Code cannot be copied from another source or student. You may copy code from cells that were pre-defined in this notebook if you think it is useful for use in another part of the notebook.\n",
    "- All images must be generated from data generated in your code. Do NOT import/display images generated outside your code.\n",
    "- Your analysis must be your own, but if you quote text or equations from another source make sure to cite the reference.\n",
    "- It is assumed that PyTorch is already installed according to the CADE or the COLAB tutorial.\n",
    "- For all analyses you write, in the case that you ran code to get to its conclusions, you should provide code that provides evidence for these conclusions. This code should print the numbers that are cited, or plot a graph, or print a table, or, even better, a combination of these. Do not erase or comment code and its outputs in the case you cite them in your analyses.\n",
    "- You should provide evidence that your code satisfies all the constraints of the questions. For showing that numeric constraints are satisfied, provide some kind of printed number, and not only a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other notes:\n",
    "- Cells should be run in order, using Shift+Enter.\n",
    "- Read all the provided code cells and its comments, as it contains variables and information that you may need to use to complete the notebook.\n",
    "- To create a text cell, create it with the \"+\" button and change its type from \"Code\" to \"Markdown\" using the top menu. To modify a text cell, double click on it.\n",
    "- If you are interested, you can check detail on formatting markdown text here: https://medium.com/ibm-data-science-experience/markdown-for-jupyter-notebooks-cheatsheet-386c05aeebed\n",
    "- The accuracies provided as required for each question are there to make sure you work enough on each model to get a good result. Part of the grade is based on this.\n",
    "- We assume a GPU of at least 4GB of memory is available. If you want to try running the assignment with a GPU that has less than that, you can try changing the argument passed when calling the ```define_gpu_to_use``` function.  If you are getting out-of-memory errors for the GPU, you may want to check what is occupying the GPU memory by using the command ```!nvidia-smi```, which gives a report of the use of the GPU. \n",
    "- A few PyTorch details to remember:\n",
    "    - Remember to toggle train/eval mode for your model\n",
    "    - Remember to reset the gradients with ```zero_grad()``` before each call to ```backward()```\n",
    "    - Remember to check if the loss you are using receives logits or probabilities, and adapt your model output accordingly.\n",
    "    - Remember to reinstantiate your model every time you are starting a new training, so that weights are reset.\n",
    "    - Remember to pass to the optimizer the set of parameters for the model you want to train."
